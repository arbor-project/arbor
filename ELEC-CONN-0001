## Electrical Connector Recommendation 0001
General DC Power Connectors

Scope:
- Typical DC power connections
- Inclusion of data with DC power

Out of scope:
- Best practices for PCB connectors

## Tier I - Opinionated Approach

For most purposes, the recommendation is to use XT series connectors or similar.



## Tier II - Alternatives

There are situations where XT series connectors do not meet the requirements of a system.


### High Power Applications - Anderson Power Poles

Anderson connectors are another common connector, though often bulkier than XT series connectors.


## Tier III - Legacy

### Common Power - Deans

A common legacy connector is the Deans connector. 

Negative Aspects:
- Difficulty soldering
- Exposed power leads on plug

Integration recommendations:
1. Create a Deans to an appropriate XT series connector adapter. The typical drop-in is an XT-60.


## Tier IV - Anti-patterns

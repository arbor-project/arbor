Terminology

## Tier I - Opinionated Approach

### Connectors
In most cases, connector terminology will be plug/pin and socket/port as outlined by [USITT/TSDCA](https://www.usitt.org/sites/default/files/2022-04/USITTTSDCA%20Sound%20Documentation%20Recommendations_April_2022_APPROVED.pdf) as opposed to gendered terminology such as male and female.
This is for various reasons, including practical reasons, as connectors are often not straightforward.
In the case of XT series connectors, the plug and socket assignment is based on the configuration of the electrical contacts. However, in the case of USB-C, the socket-side has electrical contacts like those of an XT series plug.

For ARBOR documentation, plug and socket assignment will be defined by the following rules:
1. Plug and socket should primarily be defined by common terminology for the connector in question.
2. Otherwise, the socket is that which is most appropriate to be fixed to a device. For example, a socket may be integrated into a wall or soldered to a large PCB.
3. Typically, normally live electrical contacts should be sockets, though they may be integrated into a connector which is a plug.

Plugs vs Pins
- A pin is an exposed electrical contact
- A plug is a generic connector which is inserted into a socket

Sockets vs Ports
- A socket is a generic connector which receives a plug
- A port is a socket which is fixed to an item such as a circuit board and typically provides a data connection

### Interface Terminology

In some cases, there is debate on interface terminology, particularly those which have terminology that reference or bear similarity to terms associated with human rights abuses. 
In general, interface terminology in ARBOR documents will favor the most common updated terminology, and deprecate those which refer to master/slave interactions. 
That being said, outdated terminology does still exist, and is referenced on this page to allow for clarity.

#### Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

SPI Terminology is to be written as recommended by [Open Source Hardware Association (OSHWA)](https://www.oshwa.org/a-resolution-to-redefine-spi-signal-names/):
- SDO – Serial Data Out. An output signal on a device where data is sent out to another SPI device.
- SDI – Serial Data In. An input signal on a device where data is received from another SPI device.
- CS – Chip Select. Activated by the controller to initiate communication with a given peripheral.
- PICO (peripheral in / controller out). For devices that can be either a controller or a peripheral; the signal on which the device sends output when acting as the controller, and receives input when acting as the peripheral.
- POCI (peripheral out / controller in). For devices that can be either a controller or a peripheral; the signal on which the device receives input when acting as the controller, and sends output when acting as the peripheral.
- SDIO – Serial Data In/Out. A bi-directional serial signal.

This is in contrast to outdated terminology:
- MOSI – Master Out Slave In
- MISO – Master In Slave Out
- SS – Slave Select
- MOMI Master Out Master In
- SOSI Slave Out Slave In

This terminology remains unchanged:
- SCK – Serial Clock. The clock for the bus generated by the controller.
